Bug -
Collections seems not to be working, try to use a working copy to see whether i can insert data
into a Meteor mongo collection.


Fix - Managed to fix the bug that is causing the meteor mongodb to not show up.
    - User must declare the variables in function(variables) to insert into the mongoDB
    - User must insert into the db to physically create the mongo Collection.
Fix - Able to store and fetch data from mongoDB.


packages installed:
1. react
2. react-dom
3. meteor remove insecure
4. meteor remove autopublish
5. npm install --save react-addons-pure-render-mixin
6. meteor add react-meteor-data
7. meteor add accounts-ui accounts-password
8. meteor add check: for using the function e.g. check(text, String)
